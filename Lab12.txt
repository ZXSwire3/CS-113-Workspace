If you were using a Map to sore the following lists of items, which date field would you select as the key, and why?
a. ISBN, because each book has a different ISBN and a map must only have one key, no duplicates
b. Uniform number, because each player has a different number on their uniform
c. Model number, because each computer has a different model number
d. Course ID, because each course has a different course number
